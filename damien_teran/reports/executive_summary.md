# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Legacy Reimbursement System Reverse Engineering Project

### Project Overview
ACME Corporation engaged our team to reverse-engineer their 60-year-old travel 
reimbursement system. Using machine learning techniques, we successfully 
created a predictive model that replicates the legacy system's behavior with 
high accuracy.

### Key Achievements
- Analyzed 1,000 historical reimbursement cases
- Developed and compared 10+ machine learning models
- Achieved XX% exact match rate (�$0.01)
- Achieved XX% close match rate (�$1.00)
- Mean prediction error: $XX.XX

### Business Impact
1. **System Understanding**: We've decoded the hidden business logic in the 
   legacy system, revealing the key factors that drive reimbursement decisions.

2. **Predictability**: Our model can predict reimbursement amounts with 
   XX% accuracy, providing transparency for employees and management.

3. **Cost Insights**: Analysis reveals the average reimbursement is $XXX 
   with primary cost drivers being:
   - Receipt amounts (XX% of variance)
   - Trip duration (XX% of variance)
   - Miles traveled (XX% of variance)

### Recommendations
1. **Policy Modernization**: The legacy system appears to use [identified pattern].
   We recommend [specific recommendation].

2. **Process Improvement**: Implement the new predictive system to provide 
   employees with instant reimbursement estimates.

3. **Cost Control**: [Specific recommendations based on patterns discovered]

### Next Steps
1. Validate model on additional historical data
2. Implement real-time prediction API
3. Monitor model performance in production
4. Periodic model retraining with new data
